USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Review Documentation:
   - Start with README.md for overview
   - Read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for system design
   - Check docs/API_REFERENCE.md for function details
   - Review docs/SECURITY.md for threat analysis

2. Run Tests:
   npm test test/GatewayTransaction.test.js

3. Deploy Contracts:
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

4. View Deployment Info:
   cat deployments/latest.json

NOTES:
- All documentation is in Markdown format
- Test suite uses Chai assertions and Hardhat framework
- Deployment script includes error handling and verification
- Security documentation covers all identified threats
- API reference includes examples and usage patterns
- Architecture documentation includes state diagrams

NEXT STEPS:
1. Review all created documentation
2. Run the test suite to verify contract compatibility
3. Execute deployment script on testnet
4. Monitor contract interactions
5. Maintain documentation as features evolve
