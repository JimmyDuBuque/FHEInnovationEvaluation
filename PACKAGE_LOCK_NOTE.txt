PACKAGE-LOCK.JSON GENERATION NOTE
==================================

The package-lock.json file is generated automatically when running:
  npm install

This file locks all dependency versions to ensure consistent installations
across different environments and team members.

Generation Instructions:
1. Ensure package.json is properly configured with all dependencies
2. Run: npm install
3. Commit the generated package-lock.json to version control

DO NOT manually edit package-lock.json.
Always use npm commands to manage dependencies:
  - npm install <package>
  - npm update <package>
  - npm remove <package>

The package-lock.json file will be generated with these dependencies based on
the project's package.json configuration.
